Botcamp Project for Grid Bot
The project consists of 9 converted Hummingbot controllers, a smoothing library, and a strategy file.
The job will be to debug and troubleshoot the controllers in python to work in the Hummingbot Dashboard and framework.
Successful debug of the files will be shown as the signals replicating across platforms and coming in on the same candles as they do on Tradingview. That ensures the computation and calculations results are the same across platforms.
There are source files of all controllers from other indicators in either Pine Script or Thinkscript.
The completed project will have each controller fully functional individually in Hummingbot and usable in the Hummingbot Dashboard for testing.
Only candidates familiar with Hummingbot will be considered.
------
The work is a directional controller debug job.
I converted some Thinkscript and Pinescript indicators into Hummingbot controllers that I need to have someone help me check. The overall goal was to get each one converted and functional individually then start stacking them in different ways have them work together as part of multi-indicator trading system. 
I converted the files with Cursor, but I need someone with some Hummingbot controller dev experience to help me double check things from the source files with the conversions, and adjust things as necessary to get it functional to test in the framework.
The project currently consists of about 9 controllers, a smoothing library, and a strategy file for decision handling from the stacked and weighted controller signals to vote and adjust betting bias in an experimental grid system.
I would like to get everything to a point I can experiment with things, mix and match to make bot configs for some pairs and then run trading bots in the dashboard from the converted controllers.
to doublecheck and make sure I converted the logic correctly and if not, debug to fix it.
I want someone to check that the math works the same and the indicators will function the same in Hummingbot as they do on Tradingview.
